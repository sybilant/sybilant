* Sybilant
** Introduction
   Sybilant is a "full stack" Lisp programming language for the x86-64
   architecture.  It is designed for writing high-level functional programs
   while maintaining complete control over machine instructions (when needed).
   
   It is still a work in progress, so details will be fleshed out as its
   implementation proceeds.
