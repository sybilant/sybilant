* Overview
  Sybilant is a hybridly typed, functional, full stack, Lisp programming
  language.
  
  - /hybridly typed/: it will statically check types when possible, and insert
    run-time casts when necessary.
  - /functional/: it has a rich set of immutable data structures, isolation and
    control of effects, and functions as values.
  - /full stack/: it has expressions for high-order functional programming, and
    also for assembly code.
  - /lisp programming language/: it has REPL evaluation semantics (meaning
    running a file has the same effect as would successively entering each line
    of the file into a REPL), and its evaluation pipeline is: read,
    macro-expand, compile, and run.
    
  Sybilant is also a work in progress, so the vision described here is not fully
  implemented.
